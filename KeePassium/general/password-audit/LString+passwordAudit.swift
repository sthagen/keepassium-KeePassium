Password audit checks your passwords against an online database of leaked passwords in a secure and private way.

KeePassium will send information calculated from your passwords — a kind of a partial checksum — to the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) service. \
The service will return detailed information about compromised passwords with similar checksums. \
The app will then compare the detailed checksums locally on the device and detect which of your passwords are at risk.

Your actual passwords are never shared with the online service.
