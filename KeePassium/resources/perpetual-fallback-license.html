        <h1>Perpetual fallback license</h1>
        
        <p>With perpetual fallback license, you can use some premium features even if your subscription has expired.</p>
        
        <p>Perpetual license covers all the premium features that were followed by a 1-year subscription (or 12 consecutive monthly payments). In other words, after you have been subscribed for a year or more, you get a perpetual license for the year-old version of the full app. Whenever you renew your subscription, you extend the perpetual license.</p>
        
        <p>How is this different from other subscriptions?
        <ul>
            <li><b>Classic subscriptions</b>: you <i>rent</i> a premium service. Once you stop paying, you cannot use the service anymore.</li>
            <li><b>KeePassium subscription</b>: you <i>buy</i> a premium license on a schedule. Once you stop paying, you get to keep the premium features you purchased.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>This protects you from unjustified price increases, stalled development and unresponsive support. At the same time, a steady revenue stream enables us to improve and maintain the app over the years.</p>

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <p>
        <b>What if I subscribe for less than 12 months?</b><br/>
        You will get full access to the app while your subscription is active. To get a perpetual license, you need to subscribe for at least 12 months.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Would I get perpetual premium support?</b><br/>
        Premium support is available only to active subscribers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Why the perpetual license does not include the latest version?</b><br/>
        This way customers know which features they would lose if they cancel the subscription. As a result, more people would chose to continue the subscription. With more subscribers, we can keep the subscription rates lower.
